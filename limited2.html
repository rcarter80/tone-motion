If you're on a mobile device, you may need to change your settings. Please tap the question mark and refer to the "Compatibility" section of the help panel.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>To set up your device for the performance, simply set the ring/silent switch to silent and turn up the volume. This will prevent notifications from phone calls or text messages. The music from this site will still play.</p>
    <p>Once the page has loaded, you will see a start button, which you may tap right away. Your device may request permission to access your motion data, or you may need to allow this access in your settings.</p>
    <p>The application will prevent the screen from turning off. Manually locking the screen may interrupt the sound, but if this happens you can simply reload the page.</p>
    <p>If your device loses its network connection, it will stop playing sound and show that an error has occurred. Simply reload the page once you have a connection to rejoin the performance.</p>
    <p>The label in the center of the screen indicates the mode of interactivity for the current section of the piece. "Tilt" allows you to control certain aspects of the sound by tilting your phone to the left and right or up and down. "Shake" allows you to trigger individual sounds by gently shaking your device; a quick flick of the wrist will do. "Tacet" is a musical indication that your part is silent for this section.</p>
    <p>Even at maximum volume, the sound from your phone speakers may still be quite soft. If you hold your phone close to your ear, you'll be able to hear the sound you control more distinctly. (But be careful not to hold your phone too close to your ear! Use at your own risk and discretion. Use of this site implies acceptance of these terms.) On the other hand, if you hold your phone farther away, you'll hear a more balanced mix of all the sounds being made around you. Feel free to experiment with this balance!</p>

    <h2>Compatibility and accessibility</h2>
    <!-- note to self - tested Feb. 1, 2019 on iPhone 6s and it works, but does not work on iPhone 5 -->
    <p>Compatible with iOS and Android. Older models and devices that have not been recently updated may not be supported. Recommended browsers are Safari and Chrome. (Please note that a bug in the version of Safari included with iOS 13.4 prevents the "shake" mode of interactivity from functioning; updating to any later version fixes the issue.)</p>
    <p>I hope that the site I have designed is maximally accessible to all users. If you have thoughts on improving the accessibility of this site, please feel free to contact me at ryan (at) ryancarter (dot) org.</p>
