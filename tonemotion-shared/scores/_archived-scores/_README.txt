I can use this folder to archive scores that I don't plan to use again. This is just to tidy up the organization of the /scores folder. NB: This will break existing paths for the corresponding sites (if they still exist), so if I ever need to use one of those sites again, I should move that score out of this folder and back into the /scores folder. BUT that only matters if I actually change the folder organization on the server, not my local copy.
