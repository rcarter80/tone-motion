    <h2>About this piece</h2>
    <!-- TODO: Write description of piece to put below -->
    <p><i>Shared Spaces</i> is WRITE DESCRIPTION OF PIECE TO PUT HERE. This extends my previous work with music for mobile devices in <a href="https://ryancarter.org/suboptimal" target="_blank"><i>On the expressive potential of suboptimal speakers</i></a> (a web-based piece for any number of people) and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imonkeypants/id547532522?mt=8" target="_blank">iMonkeypants</a> (an iOS app album).</p>

    <h2>Set up your device</h2>
    <!-- TODO: revise instructions -->
    <p>To set up your device for the performance, simply set the ring/silent switch to silent and turn up the volume. This will prevent notifications from phone calls or text messages. The music from this site will still play.</p>
    <p>Once the page has loaded, you will see a start button, which you may tap right away. Your device may request permission to access your motion data, or you may need to allow this access in your settings.</p>
    <p>The application will prevent the screen from turning off. Manually locking the screen may interrupt the sound, but if this happens you can simply reload the page.</p>
    <p>The label in the center of the screen indicates the mode of interactivity for the current section of the piece. "Tilt" allows you to control certain aspects of the sound by tilting your phone to the left and right or up and down. "Shake" allows you to trigger individual sounds by gently shaking your device; a quick flick of the wrist will do. "Tacet" is a musical indication that your part is silent for this section.</p>
    <p>Even at maximum volume, the sound from your phone speakers may still be quite soft. If you hold your phone close to your ear, you'll be able to hear the sound you control more distinctly, and if you hold your phone farther away, you'll hear a more balanced mix of all the sounds being made around you. Feel free to experiment with this balance!</p>

    <h2>Compatibility and accessibility</h2>
    <!-- note to self - tested Feb. 1, 2019 on iPhone 6s and it works, but does not work on iPhone 5 -->
    <p>Compatible with iOS and Android. Older models and devices that have not been recently updated may not be supported. Recommended browsers are Safari and Chrome. (Please note that a bug in the version of Safari included with iOS 13.4 prevents the "shake" mode of interactivity from functioning; updating to iOS 13.5 fixes the issue.)</p>
    <p>I hope that the site I have designed is maximally accessible to all users. If you have thoughts on improving the accessibility of this site, please feel free to contact me at ryan (at) ryancarter (dot) org.</p>

<!-- KEEP THIS VERSION OF Tone.js and don't link to different version -->
<!-- They make trivial changes to Tone.js that will break older code -->
<!-- NOTE: I'm linking to v12 of Tone.js. On Feb 13, 2020, I looked at v13.8.25, which has major changes, like toMaster() is replaced with toDestination(), but nothing useful from what I can see. Keep using v12 unless a new version has useful change or this version breaks. -->
