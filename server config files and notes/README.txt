I have two different .htacess files, one for ryancarter.org and the other for ryancarter.us. I don't want to accidentally upload the wrong file to the wrong server, so I keep them separate here. (Update: it turns out I wrote exactly the same code for both .htaccess files, but I'm still keeping them separate in case I change one and not the other.)

Also: I activated CloudFlare on ryancarter.us and I noticed in the Cloudflare Dashboard an option to bypass CloudFlare for development mode. See image "to bypass Cloudflare.png"
